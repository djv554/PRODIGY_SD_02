## Overview

This Python program is a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback if the guess was too low or too high. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number, at which point the program congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts made. The program also handles invalid inputs, prompting the user to enter a valid integer if they make a mistake.
